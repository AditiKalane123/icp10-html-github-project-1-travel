        <h2>Ekvira Devi Temple</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>About</h3>
            The Ekvira Aai Mandir is a Hindu temple located near the Karla Caves near Lonavala in Maharashtra, India. Here, the worship of the goddess Ekvira is carried on right next to the caves, once a center of Buddhism. The temple is a prime spot of worship for the Aagri and Koli people. The temple-complex originally consisted of three similar shrines built in a row all facing west. Of these, the central and the southern shrines are preserved in full, and the rest of the structures are preserved only on plan. The maha-mandapa, varsha-mandapa and gopura are situated in front of these three shrines and these three shrines are surrounded by sixteen shrines of additional parivara devatas. The devotees throng the temple on all occasions of Navaratri and Chaitra Navratra to worship and celebrate. It is believed that the goddess has magical powers.
